      <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <p>I'm an aspiring front-end web developer with a background in business-to-business print design and publishing. While I focus on changing my career, I'm working part time as the production editor of a twice-monthly magazine where I'm responsible for taking Word documents and turning them into a finished magazine - and for being the resident grammer obsessive.</p>
        <p>I love good design and how it can make life better, easier and more beautiful, and truly believe there's no excuse for ugly site layout - which is why I decided to pursue front-end web development. I'm also fascinated by why people make the choices they do and can't wait to start delving deeper into the world of UI.</p>

      <h1>Your accent is a bit...</h1>
        <p>I think the word you're looking for is "weird". I'm Anglo-American; I was born near Seattle, Washington in the US and moved to the UK nearly 14 years ago for uni, where I finished with a BA (Hons) Documentary Photography. Which, as you can see, has led to a successful career in that artistic field!</p>

      <h1>Wait, you want more?</h1>

      <h3>What are your favourite hobbies?</h3>
        <p>I'm a committed gamer, obsessive knitter, avid reader and excellent cook (if I do say so myself). I also love hiking and one day plan to walk the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camino_de_Santiago">Camino de Santiago</a> with my husband.</p>

      <h3>What's your dream job?</h3>
        <p>Eventually, I'd love to be part of a team helping to make the online world a more accessible and beautiful place for everyone. The internet is and will continue to be such a massive part of our lives, and I believe everyone should have access to the resources it contains - and that using them should be easy, simple and straightforward.</p> 

      <h3>What music have you been listening to lately?</h3>
        <p>I'm a huge fan of both <a href="http://www.kerrangradio.co.uk/">Kerrang! Radio</a> and <a href="http://www.classicfm.com/">Classic FM</a> - rather different musically, but both excellent.</a>
